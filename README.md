# Clock-App
Config files for my GitHub profile.
The project was to create an app that would tell the time given in both a 12 hour format and a 24 hour format.
It also needed to have a function to add hours, minutes, and seconds to it.
I feel like I did really well with minimalizing interactions between the functions by not assigning each of the 2 sets of numbers
for hours, minutes, and seconds with it's own variable.
By utilizing formatting I was able to shorten and better enhance the functions being used.
Getting the formatting correct for displaying the time was pretty difficult and I feel like I could print the entire menu alot better with more practice.
Google has been a big help when I get stuck on what I need to do as has zybooks but I know I won't really have zybooks when doing things on my own.
Structuring functions, calling functions, and formatting will always be important to remember going forward.
Although I'm pretty bad at rememebering to comment on my stuff I tried to pay extra attention and remember to comment what each function did and the general
idea behind some of the program calls.
